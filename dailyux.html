								<p class="fh5co-lead">The Daily UX Challenge is a 20 day exercise that focuses on problem solving, user research, and prototyping. The prompt is designed by Florian Lissot. You can sign up for the challenge, <a href="http://2is0.com/dailyux/">here</a>. I decided to embark on this challenge to utilize my design thinking skills further. I like the idea of tackling small projects within a short time frame.</p>

								<p>For the first day, the prompt was to create the perfect wallet. I began dissecting the problem by collecting research through surveys from 11 participants.<p></p> <img src="images/w-research.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project"></p>

								<p>Insights based on research:</p>
								<li>Users need a compact way to store items in their wallet.</li>
								<li>Users need to decrease the amount of items in their wallet.</li>
								<li>There is too much clutter in wallets.</li>
								<li>The wallet doesn’t hold enough cards or coins.</li>
								<li>Users make most of their purchases on groceries, clothing and online shopping.</li>
								<li>Most users prefer using credit/debit cards and cash as payment methods.</li>
								<p></p>
								<p>Conclusion</p>
								<p>Since users are not comfortable with going 100% digital with mobile payments, I’ve decided to create a digital wallet to complement using physical wallets. The wallet will store receipts, insurance cards, club cards, credit cards, debit cards, and tickets. With a digital wallet, users can compress the amount of items they carry in their wallet or use a smaller wallet. </p>

							<p>For Day 2, the prompt was to create a landing page. I interviewed a pilot who needed a website set up for his non profit organization, PAPA (Professional Asian Pilot Association). </p>

							<p>Interview</p>
							<p>What kind of content are you sharing on your website?</p>
							<p>"<i>I just started an organization with my coworkers for professional pilots. We have been spreading the word about it at networking events and career fairs. We need a web presence for current and prospective members and a means for members to reach us and sign up. </i>"</p>
							<p>What do you need your website to do? </p>
							<p>"<i>The website has to be welcoming and accessible and tells people who we are and what we’re about. </i>"</p>
							<p>Who is your target audience?</p>
							<p>"<i>Current and prospective members, potential collaborators and partners. </i>"</p>

								<img src="images/l-design.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project"> <p></p>
							<p>This landing page is a little different from most websites as it caters towards a very specific niche. The targeted users are already familiar with the organization prior to viewing the website. With that in mind, my focus was to ensure that accomplishing tasks is straightforward and seamless.

								<p>For Day 3, the prompt was to improve the experience of parking, in particular to parking payments.

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
							<p>For the 4th day, the prompt was to create a chatbot onboarding flow. I’ve decided to approach this with my voice user interface skills. Voice interfaces are similar to chatbots in the sense they both serve the same purpose, assist the user through word recognition and a dictation system. In regards to an onboarding flow, it’s the first meeting point where the user learns how the chatbot works, what assistance is provided and how they can achieve certain tasks. Successful chatbots are ones that show personality and human qualities. Most importantly, the conversation feels real. One of the most frustrating experiences for users is when they feel that they are talking to a machine and not a person.</p>

							<p>For my chatbot, I’ve decided to create one for a courier delivery service provider. I shop online often and expect packages to be delivered in a timely manner. There are times where my shipment doesn’t arrive because the courier couldn’t access the building or no one was home to sign the package. I have rescheduled the delivery a few times but the experience was frustrating. I either had to call the courier company and be placed on hold for quite some time or navigate through multiple web pages on their website. There needs to be a quicker and immediate way to contact support. </p>
							<p>The chatbot will have the following features:</p>
							<li>Track a package</li>
							<li>Schedule a redelivery</li>
							<li>Contact courier</li>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">N<sup>o</sup> 6</span>Cup of Tea</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
							<p>For the 5th day, I had the opportunity to design something for myself. The prompt was to explore prepping and enjoying a good cup of tea. This prompt felt like it was made just for me, as I am a daily tea drinker. I decided to take some liberty with this as I love many teas from around the world. Earl Grey, Matcha, Thai tea, Butterfly Pea, Assam Black tea and Rooibos are just a few of my favorites. The type of tea I want changes depending on what drink I am in the mood for. During the summer time, I prefer cold tea. In the winter time, I prefer hot teas. I love going to tea shops and cafes for a hot tea latte or a cold fruit tea. I’ve always admired their recipes and tea blends, wishing I could recreate the same drink myself so I can enjoy it in the comforts of my own home or wherever I want.</p>
							<p>To create the perfect cup of tea for any circumstance, I decided to create a tea recipe application. It would be recipes submitted by baristas around the world and provide a timer option to help users keep track of the tea steeping time. </p>
							<img src="images/t-d.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/t-w.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<p></p>
							<p>With the one day time constraint, I mocked up a few wireframes and some of the screens. Moving forward, I would like to develop a login profile for baristas to post their personal recipes to ensure the teas taste as great as they would at a cafe or restaurant. I would also add a feature to alter the recipe if the user preferred a cold or hot drink, as that would affect the ingredients, directions and recipe time.</p>
